# Day 7 - HTML Lists and Audio

Today I explored **HTML lists and multimedia elements**.  

### ðŸ“š Concepts Covered:
- **Ordered List (`<ol>`)** â†’ Creates numbered lists.  
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`)** â†’ Creates bulleted lists.  
- **Nested Lists** â†’ A list inside another list for hierarchy.  
- **Audio Element (`<audio>`)** â†’ Embedding audio files with play controls.  

This project demonstrates how lists help in organizing content and how audio can be integrated into webpages for better user experience.
