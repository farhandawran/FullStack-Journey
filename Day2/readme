# Day 2 – HTML Tables

Today, I learned how to create and structure tables in HTML.  
I explored how to use `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags along with attributes like `rowspan` and `colspan`.

## 📘 What I Learned
I practiced creating a table structure in HTML.  
I used table headers (`<th>`) for column labels.  
I added table rows (`<tr>`) to display student data.  
I also learned how to merge cells with `rowspan` and `colspan`.
