# Day 6 - HTML Media and Advanced Form Elements

Today I learned and implemented **advanced HTML concepts**:

- **Video Element (`<video>`)** → Adding a video with autoplay, loop, muted, and controls attributes.
- **Dropdown Menu (`<select>`)** → Creating a country selector.
- **File Upload (`<input type="file">`)** → Allowing users to upload files.
- **Date Input (`<input type="date">`)** → Letting users pick a date.
- **Number Input (`<input type="number">`)** → Restricting input within a range.
- **Submit & Reset Buttons** → Form controls.


This project combines multiple HTML concepts to create a complete form with multimedia and semantic structure.
