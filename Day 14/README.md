# 🌐 Day 14 – CSS Grid Layout (Product Gallery)

Today, I learned how to design a modern responsive product gallery using CSS Grid.  
This helped me understand how to build flexible, professional layouts that adjust automatically for all screen sizes.

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to use **CSS Grid** to organize content.
- Creating **responsive columns** using `repeat()` and `minmax()`.
- Adding **hover effects** and **box shadows** for a modern UI.
- Building a reusable **card component** with images and text.

## 💻 Project Preview:
A clean, responsive **Product Gallery Page** with multiple cards, each showing a product image, title, and short description.
