# Day 11 - HTML Practice  

Today I worked on three important HTML concepts:  

## 1. Nested Lists  
- Learned how to create ordered and unordered lists inside one another.  
- Example: Fruits and Vegetables list with sub-items.  

## 2. Iframes  
- Practiced embedding external content inside a webpage using `<iframe>`.  
- Example: Embedded a YouTube video directly into the page.  

## 3. HTML Entities  
- Learned how to display reserved characters and special symbols in HTML.  
- Examples:  
  - `&copy;` → ©  
  - `&lt;` → <  
  - `&gt;` → >  
  - `&nbsp;` → adds extra spaces.
