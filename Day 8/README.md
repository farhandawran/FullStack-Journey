# Day 8 – HTML Wrap-Up 

Today I covered the final important HTML concepts before moving to CSS.  

## ✅ Topics Learned
- HTML Entities (to display reserved symbols like `<`, `>`, `©`)  
- iframe (embedding other websites/videos inside a page)  
- Meta Tags (SEO, responsiveness, author, social media previews)  
- Semantic HTML Recap (header, main, footer, article, section)  

## 📝 Key Takeaways
- Entities help display special characters correctly.  
- iframes allow embedding of other sites but should be used carefully for security and performance.  
- Meta tags are invisible but crucial for SEO, responsiveness, and social sharing.  
- Semantic tags make the structure of a page clearer and SEO-friendly.
