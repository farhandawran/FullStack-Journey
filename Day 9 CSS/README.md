# Day 9 – Introduction to CSS 🎨

Today I officially started CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the language that brings design and style to web pages.  

## ✅ Topics Learned
- What is CSS and why it’s important  
- Types of CSS: Inline, Internal, External  
- Linking a CSS file to HTML  
- Basic Selectors:
  - Universal Selector (`*`)
  - Element Selector (`h1`, `p`, etc.)


## 📝 Key Takeaways
- CSS allows us to separate **content (HTML)** from **style (design)**.  
- External CSS is the best practice for reusability and clean code.  
- Classes and IDs give flexibility in styling specific parts of a page.  
- Selectors are the foundation of applying styles effectively.
