# Day 1 – HTML Basics 

Today marks the beginning of my 100 Days Full-Stack Development Journey.  
On Day 1, I started with the fundamentals of HTML and built my very first web page.  

---

##  What I Learned
- Basic structure of an HTML document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)
- Links (`<a href="">`)
- Images (`<img src="" alt="">`)

---

## 🛠️ Practice Tasks
1. Created a heading: Day 1 – My First HTML Page  
2. Wrote a paragraph about why I’m learning web development  
3. Added a link to my GitHub profile  
4. Displayed an image using the `<img>` tag
