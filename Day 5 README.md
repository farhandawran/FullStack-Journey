# Day 5 - HTML Lists

Today I practiced HTML Lists and learned:

- Ordered Lists (`<ol>`) → show items in sequence (1, 2, 3…).
- Unordered Lists (`<ul>`) → show items with bullet points.
- Nested Lists → lists inside lists (for frameworks and tools under a language).

In my project:
- I created an ordered list of my Top 5 Programming Languages.  
- Some of them include a nested unordered list for popular frameworks/tools.  
- I also added an unordered list of my hobbies.  


This helps me structure information on a webpage in a clean and organized way.
